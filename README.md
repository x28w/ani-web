## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 22.5.0 or higher ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/)).

### ⚡ Quick Install

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g ani-web
```

> **Note:** After the one-time setup, you can start the application anytime, from any directory, by simply opening a terminal and typing `ani-web`.

---

## Uninstalling

If you need to remove the application from your system, simply open a terminal and run:

```bash
npm uninstall -g ani-web
```

_This safely deletes the application files and removes the `ani-web` command from your system's PATH._

---

## Manual Installation (For Developers)

Want to poke around the source code or contribute? You can build the project manually.

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/serifpersia/ani-web.git
cd ani-web
```

**2. Install, Build, and Run:**
Use provided run scripts that offer a menu to choose between a **Development** or **Production** setup. To run a development environment manually:

1. Run `npm install` to install core dependencies.
2. Run `npm run install:client` to install frontend tools (Vite, React, etc).
3. Run `npm run build` to build the source code.

**On Linux / macOS:**

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

**On Windows:**

```bat
run.bat
```

### Commands

Once installed globally, you can use the following commands:

- `ani-web` - Start the application.
- `ani-web --version` (or `-v`) - Check your installed version.

### Data Location

ani-web stores your persistent files in your OS app-data folder instead of inside the globally installed npm package:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\ani-web`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/ani-web`
- **Linux:** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ani-web` or `~/.local/share/ani-web`

This folder contains your `.env`, database files, sync manifests, and Google token file. Existing installs will automatically migrate legacy files from the old `server/` folder on first launch when those files are still present.

## Cloud Sync (Optional)

**ani-web** can automatically sync your local data to the cloud. The app stays local-first: your
main database is a local SQLite file, and cloud sync exports/imports the app data as JSON when
needed.

Sync provider priority is:

1. **GitHub Cloud Sync**
2. **Google Drive Sync**
3. **Rclone Sync**

If GitHub is connected, it is used first. Google Drive and Rclone remain available as fallback or
legacy sync options.

### 1. GitHub Cloud Sync

GitHub Cloud Sync is the recommended setup. It uses GitHub's device login flow, so users do not
need to create a Google Cloud project, manage client secrets, or install external sync tools.

1. Open **ani-web**.
2. Go to **Settings** -> **Synchronization**.
3. Click **Sign in with GitHub**.
4. Open the shown GitHub device URL, enter the code, and approve access.

ani-web will create a private GitHub repository named `aniweb-sync-data` in your account and store
your sync data in JSON:

- Production mode uses `sync.json`.
- Development mode uses `sync.dev.json`.

The app requests GitHub repository access because it needs to create and update this private sync
repository. The GitHub token is stored locally in your ani-web app-data `.env` file.

### 2. Google Drive Sync

Google Drive sync is still supported. To use it, you need to provide your own Google Cloud
credentials:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project and enable the **Google Drive API**.
3. Configure the **OAuth Consent Screen** (set it to "External" and add yourself as a test user).
4. Create **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs** (Application type: "Web application").
5. Add `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback` to the **Authorized redirect URIs**.
6. Open **ani-web**, go to **Settings** -> **Synchronization**, and enter your **Client ID** and
   **Client Secret** in the Google authentication section.

### 3. Rclone Sync

If you prefer using **Mega**, **Dropbox**, or other providers, you can use [Rclone](https://rclone.org/):

1. Install Rclone on your system and ensure it's in your PATH.
2. Configure a remote using `rclone config`.
3. In **ani-web**, go to **Settings** -> **Synchronization** and select your remote name from the
   Rclone dropdown.

Rclone is used only when GitHub and Google Drive sync are not active.
